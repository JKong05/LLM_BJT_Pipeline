The Frogs and the Stone King
In a peaceful pond nestled deep in the woods, the frogs lived simple, happy lives. They spent their days hopping on lily pads, basking in the sun, and croaking to each other without a care in the world. For years, this was enough, and the pond remained a place of peace and harmony.
But one summer, some of the younger frogs grew restless. “We are the only ones without a leader,” one young frog said. “The birds follow the majestic eagle, and the deer have the wise stag. Why don’t we have a king?”
The older frogs shook their heads. “We don’t need a king,” they said. “We have everything we need here. Our lives are peaceful and free.”
But the young frogs wouldn’t listen. They croaked louder and louder, demanding a king to make them important, to bring order and strength to their lives. Their noise grew so loud that it reached the mighty River Spirit, who watched over all the waters of the woods.
The River Spirit appeared in a shimmering mist above the pond. Her voice was soft yet powerful, like the gentle rush of a waterfall. “Why do you ask for a king?” she asked. “Are you not content with the peace and freedom you already have?”
“We want a great king!” the young frogs croaked together. “Someone powerful, like the other animals have.”
The River Spirit sighed. “Very well. If you wish for a king, I will grant your request.” With a wave of her hand, she sent a large stone plummeting from the sky, which landed with a splash in the middle of the pond.
When the water settled, the frogs saw the massive stone sitting in the center of their pond. It was solid, unmoving, and silent.
“This is your king,” the River Spirit said before vanishing into the mist.
At first, the frogs were thrilled. They hopped around the stone, admiring its size and strength. “Look at our mighty king!” they croaked. “How strong and powerful he is!”
But after a few days, the excitement faded. The stone king never moved, never croaked, and certainly never led them. The frogs began to grow frustrated.
“What kind of king is this?” one frog grumbled. “He doesn’t even croak back!”
“We wanted a real king,” another complained. “This one does nothing but sit there.”
Once again, the frogs croaked for the River Spirit, pleading for a different ruler. “This king is too quiet,” they said. “We want a leader who is active, someone strong and commanding.”
The River Spirit reappeared. “Are you sure you want another king? A silent ruler causes no harm, but a more powerful one may bring trouble.”
The frogs, still stubborn, croaked louder. “Yes! Give us a stronger king!”
The River Spirit sighed once more. “Very well, a new king you shall have.” With a wave of her hand, the stone king sank beneath the water, and in its place, a tall heron appeared. The heron stood gracefully on one leg, its sharp eyes watching the frogs closely.
The frogs cheered, believing they had finally received the powerful ruler they wanted.
But their joy was short-lived. The next morning, when a frog approached the heron to greet him, the heron swiftly snatched him up in its beak and swallowed him whole. The other frogs croaked in terror and leaped away, hiding under the lily pads.
Their new king was a predator.
Day after day, the heron patrolled the pond, preying on any frog that dared to come too close. The once peaceful pond was now filled with fear. The frogs, who had once lived freely, now cowered in the shadows, too scared to hop or croak.
Realizing their mistake, the frogs once again called out to the River Spirit, their voices filled with regret. “Please, River Spirit! Take this cruel king away! We were wrong to ask for a new ruler. We only want peace.”
The River Spirit returned, her voice calm but firm. “Do you see now, little frogs? It is better to live free and in peace than to long for power and leadership that you do not need.”
The frogs, humbled and ashamed, croaked in agreement. “We see it now. We wish only for our simple, peaceful lives back.”
With a final wave of her hand, the River Spirit made the heron disappear, and the pond returned to its quiet, peaceful state.
The frogs, now wiser, resumed their carefree lives—hopping on lily pads, catching flies, and basking in the sun. From that day on, they never again asked for a king, content with the simple freedom they had once taken for granted.
The End.
