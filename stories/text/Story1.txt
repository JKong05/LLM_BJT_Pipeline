The rainforest was alive with music as birds greeted the morning with cheerful melodies. Maren, a small bird with bright blue feathers, sat silently on a high branch. She listened to the robins, sparrows, and nightingales singing, but whenever she tried to join, only awkward squeaks came out. Maren hadn’t found her voice yet.
One day, her friend Robin noticed her silence. “Why aren’t you singing, Maren?” he asked.
Maren sighed. “I’ve tried, but nothing sounds right. I don’t think I have a song.”
Robin smiled. “Maybe you’re trying too hard to sound like us. Your song might be different, and that’s okay. It’s still beautiful.”
Maren thought about his words but wasn’t sure. The next day, she decided to stop trying to mimic the other birds and instead explored the forest. She flew through quiet groves, over rivers, and beneath thick canopies, listening to the unusual sounds around her—woodpeckers tapping, leaves rustling, water dripping. These weren’t the usual bird songs, but they had their own beauty.
As she listened, Maren began experimenting with her own sounds—sharp chirps, soft whispers, even mimicking the raindrops. At first, it felt strange, but soon her song started to blend with the forest’s wild rhythm. It wasn’t perfect, but it was full of life.
Maren returned to her friends, feeling more confident. This time, she sang her own tune, full of unexpected twists and turns, just like the forest sounds she had heard. Her friends paused, listening. Robin smiled and said, “Now that’s a song.”
Maren beamed. Her song didn’t sound like the others, but it didn’t need to. It was hers, and it was beautiful.
The End.
