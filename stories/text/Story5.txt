The Tale of the Clever Rabbit
Long ago, in a dense jungle filled with all sorts of creatures, there lived a mighty lion named Balar. He was the king of the jungle, and he ruled with an iron paw. Every animal feared him, for Balar had a terrible habit—whenever he was hungry, he would hunt down any creature he pleased and devour them. The animals lived in constant fear of becoming his next meal.
One day, the animals could no longer bear it. They called for a meeting and decided to approach the lion with a proposal. Together, they made their way to Balar’s cave, trembling as they stood before him.
"O mighty King," said the deer, stepping forward, "we have come with a request. You are strong and powerful, and we are but humble creatures. We understand that you must eat, but we live in fear every day, not knowing which of us you will hunt next. If you allow us, we will send one animal to you each day as your meal. This way, you will always be fed, and the rest of us can live in peace."
Balar, being proud and lazy, found the idea appealing. It meant he wouldn’t have to waste his energy hunting every day. "Very well," the lion growled. "I accept your offer. But remember, if you fail to send an animal, I will hunt down all of you."
The animals agreed, and from that day forward, one creature was sent to the lion’s cave each day as his meal. The jungle was at peace, but the animals lived with sorrow, for every day, they had to say goodbye to one of their own.
One day, it was the turn of a clever little rabbit. As small as he was, the rabbit had no intention of becoming the lion’s next meal. Instead, he thought of a plan to outwit Balar.
The rabbit took his time, hopping slowly through the jungle. He stopped by the river, rested in the shade, and even nibbled on some grass, all while the sun slowly climbed higher in the sky. By the time he finally reached Balar’s cave, it was nearly evening.
Balar was furious. "Why are you so late, little rabbit?" he roared, his eyes burning with rage. "I have been waiting all day, and now I am hungrier than ever!"
The rabbit bowed respectfully. "Forgive me, O King," he said in a small voice, "but it wasn’t my fault. You see, I wasn’t the only rabbit sent to you today. There was another, bigger rabbit, who said he was stronger and more deserving to be your meal. I tried to convince him otherwise, but he challenged your authority, and we ended up running late because of him."
Balar’s eyes narrowed. "Another rabbit, challenging my authority?!" he growled, baring his sharp teeth. "Where is this insolent creature?"
The rabbit looked up innocently. "He said that he was the true king of the jungle and that you are nothing but a coward. He even claimed he could defeat you in battle! He stayed behind near the well in the jungle, saying you wouldn’t dare face him."
The lion’s pride was stung. No one had ever dared to challenge him before. "Take me to this so-called king," Balar roared, standing up on his powerful legs.
The rabbit led Balar through the jungle until they reached an old well. It was deep and wide, and its dark waters shimmered at the bottom. The clever rabbit pointed to the well and said, "He is down there, O mighty King. When I tried to stop him, he jumped into the well, saying he would wait for you to come and face him."
Balar, his eyes blazing with fury, approached the well and looked down. Sure enough, he saw a large lion staring back at him from the water’s surface. The reflection glared up at him, as fierce as Balar himself.
Furious at the sight of what he believed to be the rival lion, Balar let out a deafening roar. His reflection roared back, equally loud. Enraged, Balar leaped into the well, ready to attack his enemy.
But instead of finding a rival, Balar plunged into the deep, cold water. He thrashed about, but the well was too deep and too narrow. His mighty strength couldn’t save him, and soon, he drowned.
The clever rabbit, watching from the edge of the well, smiled to himself. His plan had worked. The fearsome lion was gone, and the jungle was free from his terror at last.
The rabbit returned to the other animals, who had been waiting anxiously. When he told them what had happened, they rejoiced. The lion was no more, and they would no longer have to live in fear.
From that day on, the animals of the jungle lived in peace, free from the tyranny of the lion. And the clever rabbit was celebrated as a hero for his wisdom and bravery.
