Sure, here's how I would retell that story as a 20-year-old:

Yo, so there was this chick Tara who was totally on edge, waiting for her scout ship to come back through this crazy wormhole thing. She's standing there, hair blowing in her face from the vents, when suddenly the psychic dude Harmon gasps. 

He's like "Yo Tara, that planet is straight fire! Tarrin says it's teeming with life, plants, animals, the whole nine yards. And get this - no buildings or anything, just nature vibes. He wants us to go there right now before anyone notices the probe is late."

Tara is pissed though, she's all "Tell that punk to get his ass back here now before I blast him when he comes through!" She's fuming because Tarrin and Mason are basically questioning her leadership by going rogue.

So I'm checking Tara out in the window's reflection, and she looks stressed as hell. Tall, dark, with this intense scowl on her face like she's about to go nuclear. But then she's low-key sizing up her crew to see if they're down for defying Earth's orders.

There's Harmon, this blonde psychic chick who seems kinda ditzy but has crazy mind powers. Then Rakal, Tara's second-in-command, who's this wolf-looking alien but is actually the leader of the Arrallin in disguise with his fur dyed black and eyes tinted purple. 

The scout ship emerges and Tara's like "Alright, send the next probe. Central's gonna be shook when they find out this is the jackpot planet we've been searching for." The alien crew is getting hyped, but Rakal growls to keep them chill - they've been burned before thinking they found a good planet.

Tara's determined though, she won't let them settle for some crappy rock that dooms their whole species. It's go big or go home for this chick.
