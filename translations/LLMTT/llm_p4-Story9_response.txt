Sure, no problem. Here's how I'd retell that story as a 19-year-old:

Yo, so there was this chick Tara who was like the boss lady on this crazy space mission. She was standing there waiting for the scout ship to come back through this wormhole thing. A strand of hair was annoying her but she didn't care, she was too focused. 

Then this psychic dude named Harmon was like "Yo Tara, the planet they found is lit! It's teeming with life and has everything we need." But Tara wasn't having it. She got all pissed and told Harmon to get the scout team back there pronto or she'd blast them when they came through. 

Tara was looking at her reflection, seeing how tired she looked after being on watch for so long. She's surveying her crew low-key, like checking out this Harmon chick to see if she's down for the mission or not. If not, Tara would just terminate her, no biggie.

Then there was Rakal, Tara's second-in-command who was this undercover alien rebel leader disguised as a wolf-looking dude. He was typing away, doing calculations and shit. 

The scout ship finally emerges and Tara's like "Aight, send the next probe. Let's see if this planet is actually the one we've been looking for." The alien dudes were getting hyped but Rakal was keeping it cool, not trying to get too excited prematurely. 

They'd been to 27 other planets already with no luck. Tara wasn't about to get her hopes up and end up on some crappy rock that would ruin everything for her and the alien rebellion. She had to stay focused.
