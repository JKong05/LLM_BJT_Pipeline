Yo, so get this - I used to work as a maid for this super fancy Hawthorne family, right? Their place was like a freaking palace, but something always felt off, you know? I couldn't remember much about my past, just that I was labeled a criminal and sentenced to serve them. Crazy, right? I never felt like I could've done anything that bad.

Anyway, one night I was cleaning the office and found this secret box with government files about implanting mind control chips in people to keep them obedient. Insane, I know. But then I saw my own file - turns out I was the leader of some resistance movement against the government before they wiped my memories! All these memories started flooding back about rallies and fighting for freedom.

Just as I was processing this mindfuck, that Hawthorne dude walked in and caught me with the files. I confronted him about it, and he tried to play it cool at first. But then his goons busted in to take me away and "reset" me again. Can you believe that shit? I was so close to uncovering the truth about who I really was.

They dragged me out kicking and screaming, but Hawthorne just stood there like a stone-cold bastard, watching them take me. I have no idea what's going to happen now, but I'm not going down without a fight this time. No way they're erasing my mind again after I finally remembered the real me.
