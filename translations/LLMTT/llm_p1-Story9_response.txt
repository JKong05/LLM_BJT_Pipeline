Sure, no problem. Here's how I would retell that story as a 19-year-old:

Yo, so there was this chick Tara who was totally on edge, waiting for her scout team to report back from checking out this new planet they found through a wormhole. She's trying to act all tough and military, but you can tell she's stressed as hell. 

Then this psychic dude named Harmon is like "Yo Tara, the planet is lit! It's teeming with life and has all the resources we need." But Tara is pissed because the scout team led by this guy Tarrin didn't follow protocol and come back to debrief first. 

She's looking around at her crew, sizing them up to see if they're down for ditching Earth and making this new planet their new home base. There's Harmon the psychic chick who seems kinda ditzy on the surface but has mad powers. Then there's Rakal, this alien wolf dude who's actually the leader of his species but is in disguise.

The scout ship finally emerges from the wormhole and Tara is barking orders, trying to act unbothered. But you can tell she's hyped because this might be the planet they've been searching for to get away from Earth's control. The alien dudes are getting excited too, making their weird animal noises.

So yeah, Tara's crew is about to go rogue and dip out to this new paradise planet if it all checks out. Crazy stuff! I wanna see how it all plays out.
