 Okay, so there's a group of frogs in a pond and they're jealous that they don't have a leader like all the other animals in the forest. So they pray to a water deity and they're like, okay, give us a king, please. We want a king, we want a leader. So the deity is at first kind of skeptical and she's like, okay.  skeptical and she's like okay but maybe you guys don't want a king because kings can be like kings are all powerful they can be ruthless but they keep demanding for a king so initially they just get a big rock that looks like a king and at first they're really happy they're like look at this rock he's our king is like so strong he's so stoic but then they realize that it's just a rock and they're like bummed about it  just a rock and they're like bummed about it so they go back to the water deity and they pray again give us like a living king we want a king that like actually moves and breathes and is alive so the deity sends them a heron which probably starts eating the frogs and the frogs start learning their lesson about the dangers of having a king so they pray to the water deity of  having a king. So they pray to the water deity a final time and they're like, okay, we're sorry, we've learned our lesson, please take the heron away, we just want to live in peace. So the deity listens to them once again, the heron is removed, and then the frogs are able to live happily and in peace once again.
