 So there's a bluebird in a forest named Marin and she's trying to mimic the other birds because she notices that she thinks that she hasn't found her own voice and she sounds very different from all the birds around her. But then her friend Robin tries suggesting like, hey, maybe just because you sound different doesn't mean you sound bad necessarily and you don't have to sound.  not bad necessarily and you don't have to sound like the other birds maybe you just have a unique song but she's not really confident about his words so the next day she goes and explores the forest and she hears all the different sounds of the forest like woodpeckers water even leaves and while she's listening to all these sounds of the forest she tries experimenting with her own song trying you  experimenting with her own song, trying to find like what feels right to her and not necessarily just mimicking the other like songbird songs that she's heard before. And then so after she listens to the forest and she comes back, the next day she's able to actually produce her own song, which is very different from the songs of the other birds.  the songs of the other birds, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because she has found her voice and it's unique and it's beautiful in its own way.
