 I don't know what's going on. There's some frogs and then a big stone came off and then this blue lady come out of the stone and then there's some conflicts and then the blue lady came out again.  The blue lady came out again, and then there was a bird. And then now, at the end, all the frogs are happy. And some frogs are in the sky, actually. Okay.
