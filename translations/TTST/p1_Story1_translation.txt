 Alright, so there's this bird named Marin and essentially like all these birds like around her like always like chirping like making their own sound and like You know just like singing throughout the day But then Marin is always silent because she believes that her voice does not sound like  that her voice does not sound like any of the other birds and she doesn't want to you know stand out from the crowd but then one day her friend Robin goes up to her and pretty much she's like yo like you need to find your own voice stop trying to copy other birds and like really look to like what makes your sound unique  to like what makes your sound unique so then she decides to go exploring in the forest and she hears like the woodpeckers pecking the water flowing and all these like unusual sounds of the forest but how she notices how each of these sounds kind of even though they sound disorganized on its own it kind of creates a harmony within  kind of creates a harmony within the rainforest to kind of have this sense of like organized chaos so maryn decides to experiment with her own sounds and when she goes back to the like to her friends the next day she starts singing and this song is very unique from all the other birds but robin says that  but Robin says that, you know, Maren found her own, like, sound in her song. So I guess the story is just about how a bird finds her own voice and, like, stops trying to, like, blend in but rather, like, embrace her uniqueness.
