 So in the desert, there is a proud lion named Balar that's really vicious and he eats every animal that he finds. So the desert animals who are afraid for their own lives and they want to live in relative peace, they come together and they give a proposition to Balar saying, hey, how about instead of you hunting all...  how about instead of you hunting all of us every day we will send one animal to you as your meal and in exchange you won't hunt every one of us that you see and balar being being proud but also really lazy he accepts this offer and then so one day it's a rabbit's turn to  day it's a rabbit's turn to be eaten and sacrificed but the rabbit doesn't want to be eaten so he gets to balar's den very late in the day so balar is very hungry and upset and asks the rabbit where have you been you should have been here earlier but the rabbit instead replies oh i met this other lion who was actually supposed to who was you  who was actually supposed to, who was saying that he was stronger than you and he wanted to challenge you. He's waiting near the oasis. So Balor follows the rabbit to the oasis where he sees in the water a reflection of himself, except Balor doesn't realize that it's a reflection of himself. He thinks it's another lion, so he jumps into the oasis.  So he jumps into the oasis and drowns in the deep water. So the desert animals are freed of the tyrant and they're able to live in peace and the rabbit is hailed as a hero.
