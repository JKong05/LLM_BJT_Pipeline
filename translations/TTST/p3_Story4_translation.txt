 Once upon a time, there was a frog community in the forest, in a pond. And one day, they decided to convene and talk about...  talk about something I don't know but so then at that night a magic magic spirit appeared and gave them a rock like in the middle of the pond  middle of the pond and they they had the rock but then the magic spirit appeared again and then suddenly there's this bird that's like the it eats frogs  it eats frogs. I don't know what it's called, but like it eats frogs and like it ate the frogs. But then the magic spirit appeared again and got rid of the bird. So then the frogs were like happy. The end.  The end.
